# CharGen (working title)
CharGen is a tool that generates random character names for Game Masters to use in their tabletop rpg adventures.
I built CharGen how to develop SPAs with Vue.js, and to gain a better understanding of state management and user authentication.
CharGen relies on Vuex for state management, and JWT for user auth.  

CharGen uses a Rails API as its backend. The repo for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/denimcouch/npc-api-rails).

## Resources
